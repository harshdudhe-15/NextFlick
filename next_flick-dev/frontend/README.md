# 🚀 React Project Setup Guide

This project is built using **React** and uses a local development server to run the application.

---

## 🧩 Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** version **20.19.0 or higher**  
  👉 [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

You can check your Node version by running:

```bash
node -v
```

## Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in the project’s root directory and run:

```bash
 npm install
 ```

 This will install all necessary dependencies listed in the package.json file.


## Start the Development Server

Once dependencies are installed, start the development server with:

```bash
 npm run dev
 ```

## Open the Application in Your Browser

After running the above command, you’ll see output similar to the following in your terminal:

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/

Copy this URL and paste it into your browser’s address bar to see the application running on your machine.


## Notes

- Ensure that your Node.js version is >= 20.19.0.

- To stop the development server, press Ctrl + C in the terminal.

- If you encounter dependency errors, try deleting the node_modules folder then run npm install again.
